            <h1>Pi</h1>
            <hr>
            <h4>Pi is such an important number that there's an international holiday called pi day and it's on March 14. Pi, or π, is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Because it is irrational, it can't be written as a fraction. Instead, it is an infinitely long, nonrepeating number. Since it is infinite, there are people who like to challenge themselves to memorize the digits of pi.The record for the most digits of pi memorized belongs to Rajveer Meena of Vellore, India, who recited <span id="bold-word">70,000</span> decimal places of pi on March 21, 2015, according to Guinness World Records.</h4>

            <h1>e</h1>
            <hr>
            <h4>e is the most important number in calculus. Without it, writing out equations would be messier and uglier. Because Euler discovered it and because he was so influential in the mathematics community, e is sometimes called "Euler's number." Euler was also the first to write e^(pi * i) + 1 = 0, which contains the five most significant numbers in all of mathematics and is the most beautiful equation in math according to multiple maths professors at Cambridge. The function e^x is the only function whose derivative is itself. The number e originated in a problem in banking and compound interest. The problem goes like this, you put $1 in a bank and the bank gives you 100% interest after a year and at the end of a year, you have $2. However if the bank gives you 50% of your money after six months and 50% of your money after another six months, you'll have 2.25$ and if the bank calculates the interest every four months giving 33.3% interest, you'll have 2.37$. So the question is, if you calculate the interest infinitely over infinitely small seconds, what's the maximum amount of money. e turns out to be an irrational number and is approximately 2.718 </h4>

            <h4>A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of the equation x^2 = −1. Because no real number satisfies this equation, i is called an imaginary number. For the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part. Despite the historical nomenclature "imaginary", complex numbers are regarded in the mathematical sciences as just as "real" as the real numbers, and are fundamental in many aspects of the scientific description of the natural world. The complex number system can be defined as the algebraic extension of the ordinary real numbers by an imaginary number i. This means that complex numbers can be added, subtracted, and multiplied, as polynomials in the variable i, with the rule i^2 = −1 imposed. Furthermore, complex numbers can also be divided by nonzero complex numbers. Overall, the complex number system is a field. Most importantly the complex numbers give rise to the fundamental theorem of algebra: every non-constant polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. This property is true of the complex numbers, but not the reals. </h4>
